# Checkers // English Draughts

## Functionality:
Checkers (actually English Draughts) game with original rules. 

There are 2 game mods: with bot playing against you and 1v1

Game has a menu where you can choose the game mode and also where the winner of the last game is shown.

Unfortunately the recognition of a draw situation is yet to implement:( The game only ends when all pieces of one color are captured.

## Launching
Pygame module is required. The next command will satisfy this:

> pip install -r requirements.txt 

Then simply run *checkers.py*

> python3 checkers.py

## Some information
This is the MIPT Programming Theory course project by me.

Here are some screenshots for you to understand how immature the project is...
